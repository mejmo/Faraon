# Faraon
- not finished and solely hobby project

One cold Sunday in December, when I was losing 5 game in a row with my gf in card game called Faraon, 
I decided to develop AI which could show me for instance tree of playable games and then
after giving the type of strategy (aggressive, passive, normal) also decision which card(s)
to play. I will continue on another rainy Sunday.

The plan is make then android application which can also recognize cards with AForge.NET/Google Goggles/etc.
